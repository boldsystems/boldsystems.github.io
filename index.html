									<p>We can adapt to your organization. Whether it is an agile shop or waterfall, we will make sure the project is delived within scope, quality and time. For critical projects we recommend using a model such the Unified Process model as described below but can adapt to other models as the project requires</p>

											<h3 class="major">Inception</h3>
											 
											<p>Inception is the smallest phase in the project, and ideally it should be quite short. If the Inception Phase is long then it may be an indication of excessive up-front specification, which is contrary to the spirit of the Unified Process. </P>
<p>The following are typical goals for the Inception phase: </P> 
<ul><li>Establish</li>
<li>Prepare a preliminary project schedule and cost estimate</li>
<li>Feasibility</li>
<li>Buy or develop it</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lifecycle Objective Milestone marks the end of the Inception phase. 
Develop an approximate vision of the system, make the business case, define the scope, and produce rough estimate for cost and schedule. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Elaboration</h3>
											<p>During the Elaboration phase, the project team is expected to capture a healthy majority of the system requirements. However, the primary goals of Elaboration are to address known risk factors and to establish and validate the system architecture. Common processes undertaken in this phase include the creation of use case diagrams, conceptual diagrams (class diagrams with only basic notation) and package diagrams (architectural diagrams). </p> <p>
The final Elaboration phase deliverable is a plan (including cost and schedule estimates) for the Construction phase. At this point the plan should be accurate and credible since it should be based on the Elaboration phase experience and since significant risk factors should have been addressed during the Elaboration phase. </p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" height="40px"  alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Construction Phase</h3>
											<p>Construction is the largest phase of the project. In this phase, the remainder of the system is built on the foundation laid in Elaboration. System features are implemented in a series of short, time-boxed iterations. Each iteration results in an executable release of the software. It is customary to write full-text use cases during the construction phase and each one becomes the start of a new iteration.</p><p>Common Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams used during this phase include activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, collaboration diagrams, State Transition diagrams and interaction overview diagrams. Iterative implementation for the lower risks and easier elements are done. The final Construction phase deliverable is software ready to be deployed in the Transition phase. .</p>

											<h3 class="major">Transition</h3>
											<p>The final project phase is Transition. In this phase the system is deployed to the target users. Feedback received from an initial release (or initial releases) may result in further refinements to be incorporated over the course of several Transition phase iterations. The Transition phase also includes system conversions and user training.</p>
